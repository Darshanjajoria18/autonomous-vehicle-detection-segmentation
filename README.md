OBJECT DETECTION YOLO
1.) Defined the YOLOv5 model architecture, leveraging its capabilities for real-time object detection
2.) Conducted the training process with built-in checkpointing to save the best-performing weights, ensuring optimal model performance.

SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION OF INDIAN ROADS USING DEEPLABV3+ ARCHITECTURE
1.) USED THE IDD DATASET (BY IIIT HYDERABAD).
2.) MADE TRAINING PIPELINE USING THE DATA API OF TENSORFLOW.
FIRST LOADED ALL THE ADDRESSES OF IMAGES AND MASKS.
MADE A FUNCTION FOR READING, RESIZING AND NORMALIZING THE IMAGES
MADE A tf.data.Dataset OBJECT AND MADE A TRAIN AND VAL DATASET SO AS TO LOAD THE IMAGES AND MASKS IN BATCHES.
3.) DEFINED THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE - USED XCEPTION PRETRAINED MODEL AS THE BASE MODEL.
4.) CARRIED OUT THE TRAINING PROCESS AND MADE CHECKPOINTER TO SAVE BEST WEIGHTS ONLY.
5.) MADE PREDICTION ON CAMPUS ROADS OF IIT BHU FOR INFERENCE AND THEN DEPLOYED THE MODEL INTO THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE OF TEAM AVERERA.
